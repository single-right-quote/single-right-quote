Hi. I like writing software that helps me understand and be able to recreate
infrastructure; I like to publish the results in hopes that it might help others
with the same. <!-- i would like to think myself something of a punk --> I
particularly like writing helper scripts and Real Programs in
[execline](https://skarnet.org/software/execline/), even as it was never
designed with the latter in mind. Its restrictions can make for fun puzzles that
have helped me to much better understand how shells and even Unix work.

Currently, I&#8217;m working on documenting a
[publicfile](https://cr.yp.to/publicfile.html)-like httpd whose spirit is
increasingly deviating from its inspiration; after that I plan to write a small
series of patches, and probably also a trivial C library, to work around
mostly-insignificant frustrations I have with the source code for the skarnet
software I use as infrastucture.

Aside: I GPL things in general but usually at least consider something [more
restrictive](https://thufie.lain.haus/NPL.html). Sometimes my work is so
straightforward it probably would be fine to just ISC or maybe even public domain
instead, but whatever.
